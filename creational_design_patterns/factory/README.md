## Factory Design Pattern
 
The factory pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input we need to return one of the subclass.

to specific medium. There are several different medium to send notification. The service only recieve message
what to send users and according to user preferences for medium we have to send notifications.
